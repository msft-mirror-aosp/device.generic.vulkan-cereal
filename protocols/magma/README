The files in this directory were generated using
third-party/fuchsia/magma/regen.py and reflect the standard magma protocol.
However, as emugen does not have the ability to generate binding code for nested
pointers, some method signatures must be modified to use a packed format. For
clarity, these are defined alongside the original (disabled) signatures and
labeled "fudge" methods.
